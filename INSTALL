How to build SimGear
====================

SimGear uses the CMake build system to generate a platform-specific
build environment.  CMake reads the CMakeLists.txt files that you'll
find throughout the source directories, checks for installed
dependencies and then generates the appropriate build system.

If you don't already have CMake installed on your system you can grab
it from http://www.cmake.org, use version 2.6.4 or later.

Under unices (i.e. Linux, Solaris, Free-BSD, HP-Ux, OSX) use the cmake
or ccmake command-line utils. Preferably, create an out-of-source
build directory and run cmake or ccmake from there. The advantage to
this approach is that the temporary files created by CMake won't
clutter the source directory, and also makes it possible to have
multiple independent build targets by creating multiple build
directories. In a directory alongside the SimGear source directory
use:

    mkdir sgbuild
    cd sgbuild
    cmake ../simgear -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make
    sudo make install
