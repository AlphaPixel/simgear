For your convenience and allowed by Boost's license terms, a subset of
Boost is bundled with SimGear in $(top_srcdir)/src-libs/.

Boost must be installed before you can build SimGear.

Once Boost is installed you can return to configuring and building
Simgear.

This subset of Boost is taken from the current release, 1.27.0.

Up to date Boost documentation is available at http://www.boost.org
