[This file is mirrored in both the FlightGear and SimGear packages.]

You *must* have the development components of OpenAL installed on your system
to build FlightGear!"  You can get a copy here:

Build notes:

The OpenAL developers do not make "versioned" releases so we recommend that
you pull the latest version via anonymous CVS (follow the instructions at
the OpenAL web site) and build/install that.
