New in 0.0.7
* March 29, 2000
* Added support for RedHat package building contributed by Habibie 
  <habibie@MailandNews.com>
* Added gdbm to SimGear.  Many systems will already have gdbm installed so
  it is only built if it doesn't already exist on the user's platform.
  gdbm is a set of database routines that use extendible hashing and works
  similar to the standard UNIX dbm routines.  This guarantees the availability
  of gdbm to any application that uses SimGear.
