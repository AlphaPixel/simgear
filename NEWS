New in 0.0.16
* July 12, 2001
* Various changes to the property manager implimentation to better support
  dumping out the desired portions of the property tree to file.
* Don't compile the metakit demos by default (causes problems for Irix)'
* Other various tweaks for Irix.
* Added a virtual destructor to XMLVisitor to fix a warning message.
* Check for valid hostname lookup in sg_socket.cxx
* Add a function to return modified julian date without creating an
  entire SGTime class.  This avoids an extraneous warning about not
  being able to find a timezone.
* Created a mailing list for cvs commit messages.
* Fixed a potential array under/over run bug in interpolator.cxx
* Removed all references to SGValue from the property manager.  Added
  support for an "archive" bit in the property manager to control
  which values get written out.
* Added SGCommandState class so that commands can compile and save
  copies of their arguments for efficiency if they are called multiple
  times.
* Added Brian Baul's "tr" tiled rendering low level support library.
  This along with some higher level code in flightgear allows us to do
  ultra-hires tiled screen dumps suitable for large format printers.

* Various bug fixes, tweaks, and optimizations.
* Added a command manager (analogous to the property manager)
* Better Irix Mips support.
* Various gcc-3.0 fixes.
* Various MSVC fixes.
* Added MSVC project files (automatically generated from the unix

* Added IO routines for a lowlevel, native simgear binary 3d file
  format optimized for TerraGear terrain.
* Better endianness checking and support for the binary file
  read/write routines.
* Added doxygen comments for all public interface code.  Documentation
  can be accessed via the SimGear web page.
* Many FG -> SG name space changes for better consistancy throughout
  this package.
* Added property aliases, repeated name tags, and a general xml
  inclusion facilities.  Many other property manager clean ups
  following a complete rewrite.

New in 0.0.14
* December 14, 2000
* Added a module to manage waypoints and routes, calculate bearing and
  distance to next waypoint, lateral distance off route, etc.
* Moved some of the basic time management code over from flightgear.
* Bucket dimensions can be returned in meters
* Added SOCK_STREAM (TCP) socket support to the networking code.
* Updated random number generator interface so application can provide
  it's own seed value as well as use the default time seed.
* Added a routine to calculate the distance between a point and a line segment.
* Updates to the property manager and the property list loader/saver.
* Added an explanation of the rational behind our terrain texture coordinate
  generation code.
* Fixed sky dome so that the color at the horizon will always match
  the specified fog color.
* Did a fair amount of fg -> sg name space updating (lots left to do.)
* Added support for KAI C++ on linux.
* MSVC tweaks.
* MacOS tweaks.
* FreeBSD tweaks.

New in 0.0.13
* September 14, 2000
* Added support for reading and writing xml files (easyxml)
* Then updates to property manager and xml code.
* Update magnetic variation code.
* Sky code now uses glPushAttrib and glPopAttrib so it plays better with
  other ssg based apps.
* MacOS tweaks.
* MSVC tweaks.

New in 0.0.12
* July 19, 2000
* Converted project license from GPL to LGPL.
* Moved low level IO (socket, file, serial) code over to SimGear.
* Moved ephemeral code into simgear
* Moved basic world time code into simgear
* Added a property manager (registry)
* Some documentation added.

New in 0.0.11
* July 3, 2000
* Replaced gdbm with metakit
* Added drop in sky (depends on plib)
* Added spherical course and dist given two points calculations
* MSVC5 fixes
* Math/bucket/tiling tweaks from Norman Vine

New in 0.0.7
* March 29, 2000
* Added support for RedHat package building contributed by Habibie 
  <habibie@MailandNews.com>
* Added gdbm to SimGear.  Many systems will already have gdbm installed so
  it is only built if it doesn't already exist on the user's platform.
  gdbm is a set of database routines that use extendible hashing and works
  similar to the standard UNIX dbm routines.  This guarantees the availability
  of gdbm to any application that uses SimGear.
* Optimizations and bullet proofing of magnetic variation code by Norman 
  Vine and Ed Williams

New in 0.0.6
* March 27, 2000
* Added Nima World Magnetic Model 2000 contributed by Ed Williams
* Fixes for MSVC++

New in 0.0.5
* March 17, 2000
* Restructured directory layout to facilitate windows/mac IDE builds.

New in 0.0.4
* Removed mat3.h and friends (we now use plib's sg lib for these sorts of 
  things.)

New in 0.0.3
* Release that conincides with FlightGear-0.7.2
