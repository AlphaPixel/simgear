New in 0.0.14
* December 14, 2000
* Added a module to manage waypoints and routes, calculate bearing and
  distance to next waypoint, lateral distance off route, etc.
* Moved some of the basic time management code over from flightgear.
* Bucket dimensions can be returned in meters
* Added SOCK_STREAM (TCP) socket support to the networking code.
* Updated random number generator interface so application can provide
  it's own seed value as well as use the default time seed.
* Added a routine to calculate the distance between a point and a line segment.
* Updates to the property manager and the property list loader/saver.
* Added an explanation of the rational behind our terrain texture coordinate
  generation code.
* Fixed sky dome so that the color at the horizon will always match
  the specified fog color.
* Did a fair amount of fg -> sg name space updating (lots left to do.)
* Added support for KAI C++ on linux.
* MSVC tweaks.
* MacOS tweaks.
* FreeBSD tweaks.

New in 0.0.13
* September 14, 2000
* Added support for reading and writing xml files (easyxml)
* Then updates to property manager and xml code.
* Update magnetic variation code.
* Sky code now uses glPushAttrib and glPopAttrib so it plays better with
  other ssg based apps.
* MacOS tweaks.
* MSVC tweaks.

New in 0.0.12
* July 19, 2000
* Converted project license from GPL to LGPL.
* Moved low level IO (socket, file, serial) code over to SimGear.
* Moved ephemeral code into simgear
* Moved basic world time code into simgear
* Added a property manager (registry)
* Some documentation added.

New in 0.0.11
* July 3, 2000
* Replaced gdbm with metakit
* Added drop in sky (depends on plib)
* Added spherical course and dist given two points calculations
* MSVC5 fixes
* Math/bucket/tiling tweaks from Norman Vine

New in 0.0.7
* March 29, 2000
* Added support for RedHat package building contributed by Habibie 
  <habibie@MailandNews.com>
* Added gdbm to SimGear.  Many systems will already have gdbm installed so
  it is only built if it doesn't already exist on the user's platform.
  gdbm is a set of database routines that use extendible hashing and works
  similar to the standard UNIX dbm routines.  This guarantees the availability
  of gdbm to any application that uses SimGear.
* Optimizations and bullet proofing of magnetic variation code by Norman 
  Vine and Ed Williams

New in 0.0.6
* March 27, 2000
* Added Nima World Magnetic Model 2000 contributed by Ed Williams
* Fixes for MSVC++

New in 0.0.5
* March 17, 2000
