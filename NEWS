New in 0.0.18
* April 20, 2002

* Created a src/libs subdirectory for several packages that need to be
  installed by the user but are used by many other packages and may already
  be installed.  So we just bundle the source separately as a convenience
  if the user needs to build and install these.
* Upgrade to zlib-1.1.4 (security fix)
* Upgrade to metakit-2.4.2-32.tar.gz (latest upstream release)
* Added support for point objects in the scenery file format.
* Additions to the binary file format to make it *much* more flexible.
  For each major primative type: points, triangles, fans, and strips, you
  can specify an index list of vertices, normals, colors, and texture
  coordinates.  You can skip any of these you like to save on space.
* Added support for new file features in the binary -> ascii scenery file
  decoder.
* Various code clean ups.
* Separate XML I/O operations into a separate header file.
* Major property manager rewrite, then lots of followup cleaning and
  improvements.

  Voodoo2 linux driver since it seems to have a bug in glPopAttrib().

* February 13, 2002

* Replaced some cout's with SG_LOG's


New in 0.0.17pre1
* February 12, 2002

* Removed metakit and zlib from build process.  Tarballs are still included
  for those who's systems don't provide these packages.
* MSVC fixes.
* IRIX fixes.
* Mingwin fixes.
* Mac OS X fixes.
* FreeBSD fixes.
* Added support for Intel's C++ compiler under Linux.
* Attempt to build in support for various non-compatible automake/autoconf
  versions.

  cards.

  of a live running application.

* Socket library improvements.
* Added a C++ exception abstraction.
* Property manager fixes and improvements including node path caching
  and debug tracing of property reads/writes.
* Updates/fixes to xml handling.


New in 0.0.16
* July 12, 2001
* Various changes to the property manager implimentation to better support
  dumping out the desired portions of the property tree to file.
* Don't compile the metakit demos by default (causes problems for Irix)'
* Other various tweaks for Irix.
* Added a virtual destructor to XMLVisitor to fix a warning message.
* Check for valid hostname lookup in sg_socket.cxx
* Add a function to return modified julian date without creating an
  entire SGTime class.  This avoids an extraneous warning about not
  being able to find a timezone.
* Created a mailing list for cvs commit messages.
* Fixed a potential array under/over run bug in interpolator.cxx
* Removed all references to SGValue from the property manager.  Added
  support for an "archive" bit in the property manager to control
  which values get written out.
* Added SGCommandState class so that commands can compile and save
  copies of their arguments for efficiency if they are called multiple
  times.
* Added Brian Baul's "tr" tiled rendering low level support library.
  This along with some higher level code in flightgear allows us to do
  ultra-hires tiled screen dumps suitable for large format printers.

* Moved some of the basic time management code over from flightgear.

* July 19, 2000
* Converted project license from GPL to LGPL.
* Moved low level IO (socket, file, serial) code over to SimGear.

New in 0.0.11
* July 3, 2000
* Replaced gdbm with metakit

New in 0.0.7
* March 29, 2000
* Added support for RedHat package building contributed by Habibie 
  <habibie@MailandNews.com>
* Added gdbm to SimGear.  Many systems will already have gdbm installed so
  it is only built if it doesn't already exist on the user's platform.
  gdbm is a set of database routines that use extendible hashing and works
  similar to the standard UNIX dbm routines.  This guarantees the availability
  of gdbm to any application that uses SimGear.

  Vine and Ed Williams
