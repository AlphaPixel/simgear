The following files were unashamedly borrowed from other projects:

zfstream.hxx
zfstream.cxx
	zlib/contrib/iostream

stopwatch.hxx was (blitz/time.h)
	blitz

Some modifications have been made to fit in with the FlightGear scheme of things.

As far as I'm aware they are all covered by GNU's licensing agreements.

Many thanks to their respective authors.
