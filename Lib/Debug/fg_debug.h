   the addition of message classes and priorities (see fgDebugClasses
   and fgDebugPriorities).  These additions allow us to classify messages
   and disable sets of messages at runtime.  Only messages with a prio
   greater than or equal to fg_DebugPriority and in the current debug class 
   (fg_DebugClass) are printed.

   defaults to stderr.  The current stream is flushed but not

   whenever fgPrintf is called.  The parameters passed to the callback are
   defined above by fgDebugCallback.  outstr is the string that is to be
